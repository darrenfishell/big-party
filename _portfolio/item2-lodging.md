Don't be confused, the Portland Westin used to be called the Eastland. That's the signature sign you see above, at the hotel with great views of Portland Harbor.

The Westin Harborview is the closest and best option to the venue. We have a [wedding block available](https://www.marriott.com/event-reservations/reservation-link.mi?id=1640189676884&key=GRP&app=resvlink) at a discounted rate.

There are plenty of other great options in and around Portland, too. If you're looking for broader trip planning suggestions, <a data-toggle="modal" data-target="#p-non-wedding-fun" data-dismiss="modal">click here</a>.
