The views of Casco Bay from Portland's East End still take our breath away. For a small city, Portland has a lot going on. These are just a few highlights:

* Bon Appetit [said you should eat here](https://www.bonappetit.com/story/portland-maine-city-of-the-year-2018).
* The city includes an island â€” [check out the ferry schedule](https://www.cascobaylines.com/) for some great day trips right from downtown.
* We live here!

But there's a ton more to see and explore in and around Portland. Sure, there's the giant boot at L.L. Bean that's just up the road a piece. But there are plenty more gems to find.

We've put together dining recommendations and more in [*this PDF*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nd5gaZdOhdE562DCBbmpBszoWG6b5t9onOWh9Qf4JQc/export?format=pdf
), which will be updated (there's great new restaurants, activities and grievances with same popping up all the time).
