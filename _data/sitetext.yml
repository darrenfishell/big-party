        year: "2012"
        desc: "We met in Portland, Maine, in 2012. Darren was a journalist of no repute and Kaitlyn was a first-year law student. They bonded over outdoor adventures and Darren tried to make a hollandaise on a really terrible electric stove (with those awful coils) that Kaitlyn saved from the brink. There were synergies."

        desc: "By the next fall, we and our new cat Smithereens (a.k.a. Smitty) moved in to an apartment in Portland's West End, the neighborhood where they live _to this very day_. In July, we had taken our first kayak trip to Warren Island State Park, putting a tandem kayak on top of Darren's Toyota Camry and then driving that Camry onto a State Ferry to Islesboro. We then packed the kayak and paddled it the relatively short distance to the neighboring island/state park, learning that what they say about tandem kayaks is true: you learn a lot about yourself."

To this day, he remains incensed by [predatory electricity sales](https://www.themainemonitor.org/private-electricity-suppliers-cost-mainers-132-million-more-than-necessary/)."

Smitty and Bernie joined for their first air travel. We enjoyed the rare treat of al fresco Thanksgiving and Kaitlyn bought a California car (coveted in Maine for their rustlessness), which we drove back to Maine."
